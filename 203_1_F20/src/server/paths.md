# Endpoint Schemes

All user endpoints will follow a User, Action, Target pattern.
This way is intuitive, as English operates on a subject verb direct-object pattern
often times.

## Planned Endpoints
- /admin/
- /poke/register/name=<name>
- /poke/<user>/friends/remove/uuid=<target>
- /poke/<user>/friends/add/uuid=<target>
- /poke/<user>/update/
